                        </div>
                        <p>Our Global Wealth Management model is centered on that of an External Asset Manager. DFC has agreements in place with various globally acclaimed custodian banks. Our business model gives us the independence to advise on multiple custodian banks in comparison to being constrained by a single set of in house solutions.</p>
                        <p>DFC endeavors to provide the highest standard of personalized relationship management. Our asset managers and relationship managers take the time to listen to clients and understand their requirements in detail on an individual basis so as to ascertain the right choice and mix of investment banking options. We take great pride in working side by side with our clients to understand their financial dreams and turn them into a reality.</p>
                        <p>Our Global Wealth Management model includes but is not limited to legacy planning, advisory services targeted towards individuals and corporations with investment portfolios and real estate/ business assets, managing the client’s private banking relationships with multiple custodian banks, negotiating cost effective fees across all private banking relationships, coordinating with the investment and corporate banking teams to facilitate the client’s business needs and producing consolidated investment statements thus providing clients with a holistic view of all of their private banking relationships.</p>
                        <h3>Wealth Management Products</h3>
                        <p>DFC core strategy revolves around a bespoke tailoring approach. Our teams conduct extensive research and analysis in order to identify customer segments with a particular need and then develop products and services to cater to that particular niche. We carefully craft each bespoke investment product to meet the risk/ reward appetite of every client on an individual basis. Our product development team together with the Asset and Relationship Managers ensures that the client’s each and every need is met by engaging in proactive dialogue with our clients.</p>

                        <p>Investing in Projects that Drive Economic Growth and Enhance Quality of Life Globally.</p>
                        <p>The scale of global infrastructure investment demand is enormous, and there is a growing need to replace and expand international infrastructure including all parts of the energy supply chain and a wide array of public services such as roads, railways, energies/power plants, airports, and communications networks. Initiatives in these areas have become more difficult due to a reduction in traditional public funding and weakened economic conditions in many regions of the world. These resource issues have created a heightened need for experienced private capital.</p>
                        <p>We are committed to helping to meet this resource imbalance by investing in infrastructure assets on a global basis. Our goal is to achieve returns through the acquisition and operational improvement of infrastructure assets, which are important to the functioning of federal, regional and local economies. We look to use these investments to generate current income and capital appreciation for our clients and partners.</p>
                        <p>Infrastructure is one of <span>DFC's</span> most active investment areas. Over the last 10 years, we have invested in more than $10 billion of infrastructure-related projects globally using our subsidiary companies.</p>
                        <p>DFC’s approach to infrastructure investing is one that puts a focus on responsible stewardship and community engagement. In areas such as clean power, energy transmission, clean water, communications technology, civil construction, real estate and many others, we have helped move forward sustainable projects that drive local economic growth and job creation, and enhance quality of life. In doing so, we work closely with civic stakeholders to help make sure that critical infrastructure is developed in a responsible manner that is responsive to community needs.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Wealth planning, financial restructuring, business case evaluation and adaptation, client segmentation and go-to-market strategy, new products & trends identification, structuring and launch, adapted marketing and marketing tools; business network streamlining and optimization.</p>
                        <p>To enable you to invest successfully, we want to record and understand all aspects of your situation and your goals by means of a strategy discussion. During this interview, your investor profile will also be assessed on the basis of your willingness to take risks and your risk capacity. Our consultants proceed in a structured manner. A precisely defined advisory process creates the prerequisite for defining a tailor-made investment solution for you. During regular update meetings, the investment solution is reviewed, taking into account any changes in the personal situation, goals and market developments, and adjustments are made if necessary.</p>
                        <h3>Systematic analysis</h3>
                        <p>Our experts monitor worldwide market developments on a daily basis and analyse developments in the financial markets and in companies. Based on these findings, they develop a clear position and assessment of markets and asset classes that are unique to DFC. Depending on the investment solution, this knowledge is implemented directly for you when investing or you receive appropriate investment recommendations in order to be able to react to market developments and take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
                        <h3>Appropriate strategy</h3>
                        <p>Investors' needs and objectives are very individual. One can and wants to take more risks in order to generate a higher return, the other prefers to invest his money safely and in a balanced manner. The following questions need to be answered when choosing the most suitable investment strategy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are your long-term financial goals and framework conditions?</li>
                            <li>What are your return expectations?</li>
                            <li>More importantly what fluctuation risks are you prepared to bear?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These and other considerations are discussed in a joint strategy discussion and lead to an investment strategy that is optimally tailored to you and your needs.</p>
                        <h3>High level of discipline</h3>
                        <p>Perhaps the most decisive factor for successful investment is discipline. The consistent implementation and monitoring of the defined investment strategy includes the continuous expansion of your portfolio and the allocation of investments to different asset classes. This avoids unnecessary investment risks such as emotional decisions, too much weighting of individual investment products, sectors and regions, or falling below a certain minimum credit rating of fixed-interest securities, which can have a negative impact on portfolio development.</p>

                        <p>DFC has longstanding and deep expertise in natural resources, having invested in the industry since 2015. As an extension of its flagship private equity business, DFC has built a dedicated natural resources investment franchise, which today has approximately $30 billion in assets under management. While our global flagship private equity funds invest in the natural resources space, we identified an incremental need for capital across the energy, metals and mining, and agriculture sectors and raised dedicated natural resources private equity funds to take advantage of the opportunity. Today, these funds co-invest alongside the flagship funds in larger opportunities as well as pursue smaller compelling opportunities on their own. </p>
                        <p>DFC’s natural resources franchise benefits from a dedicated investment team with deep industry knowledge; an extensive network of relationships across the energy, metals and mining, and agriculture sectors; and an ability to create downside-protected portfolios across multiple natural resources sectors focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At DFC we understand the design, negotiation and implementation of entity structures to accommodate multiple rounds of financing, equity incentives and, most importantly, significant growth. Because we understand the practices and expectations of the venture community, we are equally suited to guide companies planning for venture capital.</p>
                        <p>We understand the role that both the entrepreneur and the lender play in a joint venture. Simply stated, a joint venture is a loan option that merges the passion and vision of an entrepreneur with the financial backing of the lender. Together, these two entities form a single purpose entity called a joint venture.</p>
                        <p>Joint ventures marry money to knowledge and opportunity and clearly define what both parties will receive at the outcome of the project. In a typical joint venture, the lender will receive a percentage of ownership in the project on top of collecting the interest rate on the loan.</p>
                        <p>The joint venture’s entrepreneur will also receive a percentage of ownership in the project and often receives compensation for his or her time for the role they play (general contractor, etc.). Traditionally, the investor is paid back in full, plus interest, before the entrepreneur receives any monetary compensation.</p>
