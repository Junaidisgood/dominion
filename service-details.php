                        </div>
                        <p>Our Global Wealth Management model is centered on that of an External Asset Manager. DFC has agreements in place with various globally acclaimed custodian banks. Our business model gives us the independence to advise on multiple custodian banks in comparison to being constrained by a single set of in house solutions.</p>
                        <p>DFC endeavors to provide the highest standard of personalized relationship management. Our asset managers and relationship managers take the time to listen to clients and understand their requirements in detail on an individual basis so as to ascertain the right choice and mix of investment banking options. We take great pride in working side by side with our clients to understand their financial dreams and turn them into a reality.</p>
                        <p>Our Global Wealth Management model includes but is not limited to legacy planning, advisory services targeted towards individuals and corporations with investment portfolios and real estate/ business assets, managing the client’s private banking relationships with multiple custodian banks, negotiating cost effective fees across all private banking relationships, coordinating with the investment and corporate banking teams to facilitate the client’s business needs and producing consolidated investment statements thus providing clients with a holistic view of all of their private banking relationships.</p>
                        <h3>Wealth Management Products</h3>
                        <p>DFC core strategy revolves around a bespoke tailoring approach. Our teams conduct extensive research and analysis in order to identify customer segments with a particular need and then develop products and services to cater to that particular niche. We carefully craft each bespoke investment product to meet the risk/ reward appetite of every client on an individual basis. Our product development team together with the Asset and Relationship Managers ensures that the client’s each and every need is met by engaging in proactive dialogue with our clients.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>DFC mission and vision is to utilize unrivalled resources and innovation to advocate the creation, preservation and diversification of wealth for a limited and select group of member clients and partners.</p>
                        <p>We provide a complete range of premium private investment banking services utilizing entrepreneurial expertise on an as-and-when needed basis. Each member client has unlimited access to some of the most experienced and creative minds in the industries we serve. Each of our professionals culturally embraces the role of advocate on behalf of our member clients and has proven repeatedly that there is a difference in the quality of investment bankers and the results they can deliver. Membership has its benefits, and in this case, it’s optimizing the wealth of our member clients.</p>
                        <p>Nothing short of advocacy is acceptable in a business environment that is different, somewhat frightening and constantly changing. The current environment, however, is no less rich in opportunity for those who can get real, get courage, and get going – especially with a trusted financial management advisor by their side.</p>
                        <p>Many investment banking firms offer professionals whose perspective on any engagement is limited to their background and experience primarily as bankers – a financial perspective singularly focused on a specific transaction.</p>
                        <p>The hand-picked professionals of DFC have the highest level of financial expertise supplemented with an in-depth level of experience as entrepreneurs, executive corporate leaders, direct real estate and retail operators and capital markets and mergers and acquisition specialists.</p>
                        <p>This well-rounded experience now becomes a value-add that other firms cannot offer. The ability to see and understand a business through the eyes of management causes complete alignment between a company and its professionals.</p>

                        <p>Investing in Projects that Drive Economic Growth and Enhance Quality of Life Globally.</p>
                        <p>The scale of global infrastructure investment demand is enormous, and there is a growing need to replace and expand international infrastructure including all parts of the energy supply chain and a wide array of public services such as roads, railways, energies/power plants, airports, and communications networks. Initiatives in these areas have become more difficult due to a reduction in traditional public funding and weakened economic conditions in many regions of the world. These resource issues have created a heightened need for experienced private capital.</p>
                        <p>We are committed to helping to meet this resource imbalance by investing in infrastructure assets on a global basis. Our goal is to achieve returns through the acquisition and operational improvement of infrastructure assets, which are important to the functioning of federal, regional and local economies. We look to use these investments to generate current income and capital appreciation for our clients and partners.</p>
                        <p>Infrastructure is one of <span>DFC's</span> most active investment areas. Over the last 10 years, we have invested in more than $10 billion of infrastructure-related projects globally using our subsidiary companies.</p>
                        <p>DFC’s approach to infrastructure investing is one that puts a focus on responsible stewardship and community engagement. In areas such as clean power, energy transmission, clean water, communications technology, civil construction, real estate and many others, we have helped move forward sustainable projects that drive local economic growth and job creation, and enhance quality of life. In doing so, we work closely with civic stakeholders to help make sure that critical infrastructure is developed in a responsible manner that is responsive to community needs.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Wealth planning, financial restructuring, business case evaluation and adaptation, client segmentation and go-to-market strategy, new products & trends identification, structuring and launch, adapted marketing and marketing tools; business network streamlining and optimization.</p>
                        <p>To enable you to invest successfully, we want to record and understand all aspects of your situation and your goals by means of a strategy discussion. During this interview, your investor profile will also be assessed on the basis of your willingness to take risks and your risk capacity. Our consultants proceed in a structured manner. A precisely defined advisory process creates the prerequisite for defining a tailor-made investment solution for you. During regular update meetings, the investment solution is reviewed, taking into account any changes in the personal situation, goals and market developments, and adjustments are made if necessary.</p>
                        <h3>Systematic analysis</h3>
                        <p>Our experts monitor worldwide market developments on a daily basis and analyse developments in the financial markets and in companies. Based on these findings, they develop a clear position and assessment of markets and asset classes that are unique to DFC. Depending on the investment solution, this knowledge is implemented directly for you when investing or you receive appropriate investment recommendations in order to be able to react to market developments and take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
                        <h3>Appropriate strategy</h3>
                        <p>Investors' needs and objectives are very individual. One can and wants to take more risks in order to generate a higher return, the other prefers to invest his money safely and in a balanced manner. The following questions need to be answered when choosing the most suitable investment strategy:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are your long-term financial goals and framework conditions?</li>
                            <li>What are your return expectations?</li>
                            <li>More importantly what fluctuation risks are you prepared to bear?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These and other considerations are discussed in a joint strategy discussion and lead to an investment strategy that is optimally tailored to you and your needs.</p>
                        <h3>High level of discipline</h3>
                        <p>Perhaps the most decisive factor for successful investment is discipline. The consistent implementation and monitoring of the defined investment strategy includes the continuous expansion of your portfolio and the allocation of investments to different asset classes. This avoids unnecessary investment risks such as emotional decisions, too much weighting of individual investment products, sectors and regions, or falling below a certain minimum credit rating of fixed-interest securities, which can have a negative impact on portfolio development.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Through existing credit relationships we are able to accommodate bank obligations such as bank guarantees (BG) and standby letter of credit (SBLC) for credit line and monetization facilities.</p>
                        <p>Bank instruments such as Documentary Letters of Credit (DLC) and Guarantees are frequently used but seldom properly understood. While these instruments are utilized in conventional trading on a day to day basis, they can also be employed in complex financial structures designed to maximize financial positions and bespoke to each individual requirement.</p>
                        <p>Commonly, Documentary Letters of Credit (DLC) are used for payment of shipped goods. Often referred to as DLCs or LCs, they serve to guarantee payment to one party upon the fulfilment of certain conditions, usually based around receiving specific goods. Wording and layout of a DLC is bespoke to the parties.</p>
                        <p>Bank Guarantees (BG) are used for guaranteeing payments in a number of given circumstances. Often referred to as BGs, they are worded specifically for the purpose and specifically written to the stated parties thereto. The use of BGs are becoming increasingly common, for example in lieu of deposit payments. Applicants may opt to issue a BG instead of parting with a cash deposit. They can also be used in intelligent financial structures. Standby Letters of Credit (SBLCs) are used in the USA in lieu of bank guarantees (BGs) and work in a similar fashion.</p>
                        <p>Through our international relationships, we are able to monetize your assets using many unique processes, customizable tools and instruments at our disposal. These unique tools will be tailored to unlock your financial potential in ways that banking institutions are unable to provide.</p>
                        <p>If you have dormant or stagnant assets like Fine Arts, Antiques, Real Estate, Tenders, Contracts, Tangible Assets e.t.c, our experienced experts can help you utilize and maximize those resources to your best advantage that may mean raising capital against them in hard cash or for trade indemnities and other types of guarantee requirements.</p>

                        <p>DFC has longstanding and deep expertise in natural resources, having invested in the industry since 2015. As an extension of its flagship private equity business, DFC has built a dedicated natural resources investment franchise, which today has approximately $30 billion in assets under management. While our global flagship private equity funds invest in the natural resources space, we identified an incremental need for capital across the energy, metals and mining, and agriculture sectors and raised dedicated natural resources private equity funds to take advantage of the opportunity. Today, these funds co-invest alongside the flagship funds in larger opportunities as well as pursue smaller compelling opportunities on their own. </p>
                        <p>DFC’s natural resources franchise benefits from a dedicated investment team with deep industry knowledge; an extensive network of relationships across the energy, metals and mining, and agriculture sectors; and an ability to create downside-protected portfolios across multiple natural resources sectors focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p>

                        <p>For young companies or companies experiencing tough financial times, it is not always easy to convince your bankers to grant finance and loans when they are needed the most. It is common to find highly geared companies in times of recession and often companies have borrowed to the hilt of their assets. Some young companies may not have any borrowings at all; not because they are financially independent, but for the simple reason that banks and lenders will not grant any credit to them.</p>
                        <p>Bankers and lenders alike will demand security for any loan or investment. If the company has already used available equity or doesn’t have access to strong security, the options of borrowing are dramatically reduced.</p>
                        <p>Shareholders can of course be approached to raise further capital and the options of bond offerings and private placements may also be made. However, these avenues are not always the best course of action or the most economical. They can be long, drawn-out processes and the company may not have time or money to launch such complex financial actions.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, it may simply be preferable to import or lease collateral assets to offer as security for conventional borrowings.</p>
                        <p>Through Collateral Management and Security Leasing programmes, DFC has experience in providing collateral and security to potential borrowers on a short term to medium term leases that the borrowers can use to secure further bank borrowings with conventional bankers or from lending institutions arranged through our partnership by providing financial Guarantees or third party corporate Guarantees from multi-national conglomerates working closely with us, making it easier for potential borrowers to obtain bank borrowings and attract further investments thus growth.</p>
                        <p>Financial Guarantees, Third Party Guarantees and Collateral Leasing can be prove an effective solution to increase borrowings or for financing temporary, short term gaps and can be efficiently used as bridging finance.</p>
                        <p>From Security Lending to Collateral Transfer, DFC is positioned to advise the best and most suited programme for your needs, offering specific solutions and providing all-in collateral lending packages designed to suit your business requirements.</p>

                        <p>With our broad scope of practice and international resources, we specialize in tailoring structures to specific legal, regulatory and tax requirements across a wide range of industries and asset types.</p>

                            <h2 class="display-4">Credit<span> Enhancement.</span></h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>We create and place highly structured credit enhancement and targeted risk capital products that provide efficient capital solutions for large investment projects. In each case, the structured product is tailor-made to efficiently mitigate risk and integrated into the overall project financial structure.</p>
                        <p>Credit enhancements are suitable for project developers or borrowers, who do not have the necessary credit rating, assets or equity capital to secure suitable financing from commercial banks and the mainstream capital markets.</p>
                        <p>Together with our financial partners and brokerage we can provide a solution for this problem. In select cases we are able to arrange for a credit enhancement or financial guarantee product to be underwritten and issued from a rated commercial bank, financial institution, government agencies or insurance company that can be used to secure repayment of financing.</p>
                        <p>The most common forms of credit enhancement loans are a stand by letter of credit or bank guarantee; however in some situations we utilize other forms to meet the needs and requirements of our clients which are more common in international transactions.</p>
                        <p>We have the preference for clients who have or can obtain a lending facility with their bank. We are then able to structure a specific type of credit enhancement service specifically for the interested lending bank’s requirements to ensure that we are able to secure the transaction to the bank’s complete satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we are capable of organizing both the Credit Enhancement Instrument and corresponding loan.</p>
                        <p>Loans and credit facilities – Structuring cross-border facilities, secured and unsecured, and trade-financing transactions.</p>
                        <h3>Loans and Credit Facilities</h3>
                        <p>At DFC we represent both financial institutions and corporate borrowers in every aspect of loan transactions. These transactions include:</p>
                        <ul class="list-group-flush">
                            <li class="list-group-item">Single bank loans and credit facilities (ranging from short-term unsecured facilities to global banking facilities involving multi-jurisdictional collateral).</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">Bilateral loans.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The transactions are typically comprised of term loans, revolving loans, letter of credit facilities, and/or bid loan facilities.</p>
                        <p>We also represent financial institutions in their capacities as agents, senior lenders or other syndicate members, sellers or purchasers of participations, and assignors or assignees of direct loan interests.</p>
                        <p>We have related and substantial experience structuring cross-border facilities, both secured and unsecured, on behalf of financial institutions and corporate borrowers, as well as advising on trade-financing transactions.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Specialists within the Group advise on and document lending transactions, counter-trade and barter transactions, and facilities for documentary letters of credit, collections, bankers’ acceptances, silent confirmations, forfeiting, and credit insurance.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At DFC we understand the design, negotiation and implementation of entity structures to accommodate multiple rounds of financing, equity incentives and, most importantly, significant growth. Because we understand the practices and expectations of the venture community, we are equally suited to guide companies planning for venture capital.</p>
                        <p>We understand the role that both the entrepreneur and the lender play in a joint venture. Simply stated, a joint venture is a loan option that merges the passion and vision of an entrepreneur with the financial backing of the lender. Together, these two entities form a single purpose entity called a joint venture.</p>
                        <p>Joint ventures marry money to knowledge and opportunity and clearly define what both parties will receive at the outcome of the project. In a typical joint venture, the lender will receive a percentage of ownership in the project on top of collecting the interest rate on the loan.</p>
                        <p>The joint venture’s entrepreneur will also receive a percentage of ownership in the project and often receives compensation for his or her time for the role they play (general contractor, etc.). Traditionally, the investor is paid back in full, plus interest, before the entrepreneur receives any monetary compensation.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Venture capital is typically provided to early-stage start-up companies that have high growth potential in industries such as biotechnology, information technology and manufacturing. Venture capital investments are generally made as cash investments in exchange for shares in the company.</p>
                        <p>Transactions range from early stage seed rounds through late stage venture rounds involving the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt instruments, warrants, and secured and unsecured bridge debt.</p>
                        <p>Utilizing our strong Lending network, venture capital is a type of equity financing that addresses the funding needs of entrepreneurial companies that for reasons of size, assets, and stage of development cannot seek capital from more traditional sources, such as public markets and banks. Venture capital investments are generally made as cash in exchange for shares and an active role in the invested company.</p>
                        <p>Our venture capital differs from traditional financing sources in that venture capital typically:</p>

                            <li class="list-group-item">Takes higher risks in exchange for potential higher returns.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">Has a longer investment horizon than traditional financing.</li>
                            <li class="list-group-item">Actively monitors portfolio companies via board participation, strategic marketing, governance, and capital structure.</li>

                        </div>
                        <p>With a land mass bigger than India, China, the US and Europe combined, few doubt the scale of the African continent and its resources. However, until recently only some have seen it as the growth market that it is fast becoming.</p>
                        <p>With a steadily growing population heading towards 2 billion, Africa’s 1.1bn workforce will be the world’s largest by 2040.</p>
                        <p>The need for infrastructure improvements in Africa is critical. Untold numbers of businesses suffer for lack of reliable power for industrial processes or because of it costs far too much to get their goods to the market. At the most basic level, millions of lives are threatened every day for lack of clean water or safe sanitation.</p>
                        <p>To help address these challenges, DFC is investing $10 billion USD in the Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund, an equity fund that will promote the development of basic infrastructure in the region. </p>
                        <p>The fund is investing in unlisted equity and equity-like infrastructure investments in Africa. It will take significant stakes in a range of infrastructure projects including toll roads, electricity and other renewable energy projects, ports, water and sewerage utilities, and social infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>Supporting improvements in infrastructure is a key priority for DFC in Africa. Our strategy focuses on is helping develop assets such as a reliable power supply, technology, telecommunication, mining, agriculture and transport networks such as roads, which are essential for economic growth and sustainability and for improving the quality of life of the people living within and across the communities they serve. </p>
                        <p>In addition to creating and investing in AFRICAN FUND, DFC supports the development of infrastructure in Africa by investing directly in infrastructure projects and pursuing advisory mandates to create commercially viable structures to further develop infrastructure.</p>
