                </div>
                <p>With a land mass bigger than India, China, the US and Europe combined, few doubt the scale of the African continent and its resources. However, until recently only some have seen it as the growth market that it is fast becoming. With a steadily growing population heading towards 2 billion, Africa’s 1.1bn workforce will be the world’s largest by 2040.
                    The need for infrastructure improvements in Africa is critical. Untold numbers of businesses suffer for lack of reliable power for industrial processes or because of it costs far too much to get their goods to the market. At the most basic level, millions of lives are threatened every day for lack of clean water or safe sanitation.
                </p>
                <p>To help address these challenges, DFC is investing $10 billion USD in the Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund, an equity fund that will promote the development of basic infrastructure in the region.
                    The fund is investing in unlisted equity and equity-like infrastructure investments in Africa. It will take significant stakes in a range of infrastructure projects including toll roads, electricity and other renewable energy projects, ports, water and sewerage utilities, and social infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supporting improvements in infrastructure is a key priority for DFC in Africa. Our strategy focuses on is helping develop assets such as a reliable power supply, technology, telecommunication, mining, agriculture and transport networks such as roads, which are essential for economic growth and sustainability and for improving the quality of life of the people living within and across the communities they serve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to creating and investing in AFRICAN FUND, DFC supports the development of infrastructure in Africa by investing directly in infrastructure projects and pursuing advisory mandates to create commercially viable structures to further develop infrastructure.
